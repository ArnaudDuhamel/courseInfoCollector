# Data analysis report
## Task
I was given a list of univeristy course codes and names. 

The list contained many duplicates

My task was to collect the following information for each course:
- If it was thought in the fall 2023 semester
- If it was thought in the campus of Gjøvik, in Norway
- If it was thought in english
- What was the study level of the course (bachelor, master, etc)

This list contained the courses chosen by the exchanges students that would be attending the university in the fall 2023 semester.

The course information at the following URL:
www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/<strong>[course code]</strong>/2023#tab=omEmnet</div>

## Data cleaning
1. Removed the term "praksis" (which means internship)
2. Manually converted # 60 61 and 62 to a format similar to the other entries
3. Extracted course codes with the "text to column" wizard. The separator was the space characters
4. Kept the course codes
5. Trimmed the coures codes
6. Removed duplicates
7. Used concat function to turn the course codes in the following format for scraping :

  |#| Courses |
  |--| ------ |
  | 1 | "IMT4123", |
  | 2 | "MT4113",|
  | ... | ... |
  
8. Scraped the relevant course information with the program in this repository
9. In the course of scraping, the following correcitons to the data were made: 

- course codes "MT4113" were replaced by "IMT4113"
- course codes "IIK1001" were replaced by "IIKG1001"
- the course codes "IMT3104" were replaced by code "PROG2051" because the website mentioned that "PROG2051" was now replacing "IMT3104"
- the course codes "IIK500" were replaced by code "IIK5000"

Because every failed http request was manually checked, along with scrapes that returned "Info not available" values.

10. The program output a csv file in the following format: 

```
"
""course_code",""semester"",""language"",""location"",""level""
""IMT4123",""AUTUMN 2023"",""English"",""Gjovik,Trondheim"",""Second degree level""
""IMT4113",""AUTUMN 2023"",""English"",""Gjovik,Trondheim"",""Second degree level""
"
```
11. The "find and replace" function of VS Code was used to replace "" by ". The first and last quotes were also removed.
12. The Ø and Å characters were replaced by O and A to allow for seamless import in a MySQL database. 

Final csv format: 

```
"course_code","semester","language","location","level"
"IMT4123","AUTUMN 2023","English","Gjovik,Trondheim","Second degree level"
"IMT4113","AUTUMN 2023","English","Gjovik,Trondheim","Second degree level"

## Data analysis

1. The csv file was imported in a MySQL database
2. The following SQL querry was performed: 

```sql
SELECT 
*
FROM 
course_data
WHERE 
(course_data.language NOT LIKE '%English%' AND course_data.level != "Norwegian for international students")
OR
course_data.location NOT LIKE '%Gjovik%'
OR
course_data.semester != "AUTUMN 2023";
```
The querry retrieved each course that did not meet the requirements.

3. The resulting table was exported
4. Ø and Å characters were reinserted in the table for finale presentation

## Final product presented to the stakeholder

## Actions to take

The stakeholder will notify each exchange student that selected one of those courses to select other courses.
